        Departments belong to a single organization. They are not shared across organizations. To learn how to create, edit, and delete departments, see

      <p class="mb-4">Departments give your organization a single, authoritative list of the teams that exist. Rather than each person describing their group differently, departments create a consistent vocabulary used everywhere in libraryOS.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">At Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, several departments co-exist under the same roof at the Scranton branch:</p>
      <ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Sales</strong>
          — the paper-selling team led by Dwight Schrute
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Human Resources</strong>
          — managed by Toby Flenderson
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accounting</strong>
          — where Angela Martin, Kevin Malone, and Oscar Martinez work
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reception</strong>
          — Pam Beesly's domain
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Defining these as departments in libraryOS means anyone can immediately see how the company is structured, who belongs where, and how many people are in each functional area.</p>

    <!-- what departments are not -->
    <div class="mb-10 border-b border-gray-200 pb-10 dark:border-gray-700">
      <x-marketing.docs.h2 id="what-departments-are-not" title="What departments are not" />
      <p class="mb-4">Departments in libraryOS are intentionally simple. They are flat labels — they do not enforce a reporting hierarchy, parent–child relationships, or budget structures. If you need a nested org chart, that is a separate concept.</p>
      <p>You can arrange departments in any display order by adjusting their position. The order you choose has no functional effect on the product; it only affects how the list appears in the UI.</p>
