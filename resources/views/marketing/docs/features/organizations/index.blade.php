      <p class="mb-4">An organization is the central workspace in libraryOS. Everything — members, offices, departments, and all administrative settings — lives inside an organization. Think of it as your company's home inside the product.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">When Michael Scott sets up Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in libraryOS, he is creating an organization. Every person he invites, every office he registers, and every department he defines all belong to that one organization.</p>
      <p>
        An organization has a
        <strong>name</strong>
        and a unique
        <strong>slug</strong>
        that is used in URLs. It also has an
        <strong>invitation code</strong>
        — a secret string that lets other people join it.

      <x-marketing.docs.h2 id="roles-and-permissions" title="Roles and permissions" />
      <p class="mb-6">Every person inside an organization has a role. The role determines what that person can see and do. libraryOS defines four roles, from most to least privileged:</p>

      <p>
        The person who creates an organization is automatically given the
        <strong>Owner</strong>
        role. Owners and Administrators can update the roles of other members from Adminland.

        Any authenticated user can create a new organization. Once created, that user becomes its
        <strong>Owner</strong>
        .

      <ol class="mb-4 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>
          From your dashboard, click

        </li>
        <li>Enter the organization name. Names may contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores.</li>
        <li>Save. libraryOS will automatically generate a unique URL slug and an invitation code for you.</li>

      <p>After creation, libraryOS runs a background job to pre-populate the organization with sensible defaults so you can get started right away.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        You do not need to create your own organization to use libraryOS. If your company is already set up, an Owner or Administrator can share the organization's
        <strong>invitation code</strong>
        with you, and you can use it to join.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When Pam Beesly joins Dunder Mifflin in libraryOS, Michael simply gives her the invitation code. She enters it on the
        <em>Join an organization</em>
        screen, and she is immediately added as a
        <strong>Member</strong>
        .
      </p>

        <li>
          From your dashboard, click

          .
        </li>
        <li>Paste or type the invitation code you received.</li>
        <li>Confirm. You will be added to the organization as a Member and taken to its dashboard.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mb-4">The invitation code is a long random string — keep it private. Anyone who has it can join the organization. If the code is ever compromised, an Owner or Administrator can regenerate it from Adminland.</p>
      <p>You cannot join an organization you are already a member of. libraryOS will tell you so and prevent a duplicate membership from being created.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">A single user account can belong to more than one organization simultaneously. This is useful for consultants, contractors, or anyone who works across multiple companies.</p>
