# Manage offices

This page explains how to create, edit, and delete [offices and office types](/docs/1.x/offices) in your organization.

## Requirements

Only users with the **Owner** or **Administrator** role can create, edit, or delete offices and office types. Members and Guests can view the list but cannot make changes. For more information on roles, see [Roles and permissions](/docs/1.x/organizations#roles-and-permissions).

## Manage office types

### Add an office type

1. Open your organization's dashboard and click **Adminland** in the navigation.
2. In the Adminland sidebar, click **Offices**.
3. On the Offices page you will see an **Office types** section at the top. Click the **Add** button on the right side of that section header.
4. A form appears inline. Fill in the following field:
   1. **Name** (required) — the name for the office type. Example: *Branch*, *Headquarters*, or *Warehouse*.
5. Click **Create** to save. The new office type appears at the bottom of the list.

### Edit an office type

1. Open your organization's dashboard and click **Adminland**.
2. In the Adminland sidebar, click **Offices**.
3. In the **Office types** section, hover over the office type you want to change. An **Edit** button appears on the right. Click it.
4. An edit form replaces the row inline. You can update:
   1. **Name** — the new name for the office type.
5. Click **Update** to save your changes.

### Delete an office type

Deleting an office type removes the classification from the system. Any offices currently assigned that type are not deleted — they simply lose their office type and become unclassified.

1. Open your organization's dashboard and click **Adminland**.
2. In the Adminland sidebar, click **Offices**.
3. In the **Office types** section, hover over the office type you want to remove. A **Delete** button appears on the right. Click it.
