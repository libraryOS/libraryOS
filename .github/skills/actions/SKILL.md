# Actions

## Rules

- Check the other actions in the project for reference, and try to follow the same structure and conventions.
- Actions are the only place where you can write business logic. Controllers should be as thin as possible, and models should only contain relationships and accessors/mutators.
- Actions are 100% testable.
- If an action does something for a user, we should always log what the user did.
- Always use Eloquent in an action, if possible.
- Actions must do as fewer DB queries as possible.
- Action must likely is tied to a permission. Permissions are managed in app/Enums/PermissionEnum.php. If the permission does not exist, create it in the Enum.

## Action Naming Conventions

Actions should represent what a user wants to do, or what the system needs to do.
The verb should try to follow when possible, the appropriate RESTful method names, like `CreateXX`, `UpdateXX` or `DestroyXX`.

```php
// ✅ CORRECT
CreateJournal
DestroyUser
```

```php
// ❌ INCORRECT
AccountCreated
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Always sanitize data first
- [ ] Always validate data: permissions, existence of related models, link to organization,...
- [ ] Create Permission if needed in app/Enums/PermissionEnum.php
- [ ] Write what the action is supposed to do
- [ ] Log the action for the user, include organization if applicable
- [ ] Write test for the action:
    - the happy path for the action
    - the case where the user doesn't have permission to do the action
    - the case where the user is not part of the organization (if applicable)
    - the case where the related model doesn't exist (if applicable)
